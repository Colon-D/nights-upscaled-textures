All textures originated from Sega, ran through the 4x HDCube3 upscaling model by Venomalia. Upscaling models are trained off of a bunch of images that I certainly don't know the copyright status of. So, who knows what these upscaled NiGHTS textures falls under?
`./ModConfig.json` was generated by Reloaded II.
`./Preview.png` is by me, wow what a lovely drawing, I think its under [WTFPL-69.420](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sean-clayton/WTFPL-69.420/master/WTFPL-69.420.txt)?
The background is a screenshot some Minecraft HD texture pack... I don't know which nor who took the screenshot...
The Nightopians are traced over Two Soyjaks Pointing by an Anon.
Feel free to do what you want with this?
